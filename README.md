# messmykeyboard

My first game made with Unity 3D, scripts written in C#.

** IMPORTANT NOTE **

Game's code is not written properly, as it was the first game in platforms like Unity, works perfectly, though.

Guide:

You are asked to enter specific words or phrases with randomized keyboard layouts.
